## Deploy pod with labels 

```
❯ kubectl  apply -f pod1.yaml
pod/ashupod-1 created
❯ kubectl  get  po
NAME        READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
ashupod-1   1/1     Running   0          5s
❯ kubectl  get  po  --show-labels
NAME        READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE   LABELS
ashupod-1   1/1     Running   0          11s   <none>
❯ kubectl  apply -f pod1.yaml
pod/ashupod-1 configured
❯ kubectl  get  po  --show-labels
NAME        READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE   LABELS
ashupod-1   1/1     Running   0          77s   x=helloashu

```
### creating nodeport service 

```
❯ kubectl  create  service  nodeport  ashusvc1  --tcp  1234:8080 --dry-run=client -o yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  labels:
    app: ashusvc1
  name: ashusvc1
spec:
  ports:
  - name: 1234-8080
    port: 1234
    protocol: TCP
    targetPort: 8080
  selector:
    app: ashusvc1
  type: NodePort
status:
  loadBalancer: {}
❯ kubectl  create  service  nodeport  ashusvc1  --tcp  1234:8080 --dry-run=client -o yaml >nodeport.yaml

```
### api-resources shotforms 

```
10045  kubectl  get  nodes
10046  kubectl  get  no
10047  kubectl  get  pods
10048  kubectl  get  po
10049  kubectl  get  service
10050  kubectl  get  svc

```

### Deleteing pods and services
